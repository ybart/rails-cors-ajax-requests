*   Make CORS requests considered as Ajax requests.

    This fixes a problem where HTML page was returned instead of JSON
    response because the CORS request was not considered as Ajax.

*   The method `shallow?` returns false if the parent resource is a singleton so
    we need to check if we're not inside a nested scope before copying the :path
    and :as options to their shallow equivalents.

    Fixes #14388.

*   Make logging of CSRF failures optional (but on by default) with the
    `log_warning_on_csrf_failure` configuration setting in
    `ActionController::RequestForgeryProtection`.

    *John Barton*

*   Fix URL generation in controller tests with request-dependent
    `default_url_options` methods.
